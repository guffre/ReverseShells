# reverse-ssh
 Golang reverse SSH client and server

Have you ever wanted to SSH in reverse? For example, have the machine that listens (the server) be the machine that gets the shell? Then this code is for you! A reverse ssh shell, written in Go!

Note, this does provide a full, functional shell. It's not a "run one command then quit". It works (both ways) on both Windows and Linux. Tested to/from Windows 10 to/from Ubuntu 18.04.
